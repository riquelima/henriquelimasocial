I will optimize the site for mobile devices and add elegant scroll animations.

1. **Mobile Adaptation & Responsiveness:**

   * **Mobile Menu:** Implement a functional "Hamburger" menu for mobile users (currently missing), allowing access to "Experience", "Expertise", and "Skills" on small screens.

   * **Typography Scaling:** Adjust the massive Hero titles (currently `text-6xl`) to be more readable on mobile (`text-4xl`) to prevent horizontal scrolling or layout breaking.

   * **Layout Adjustments:** Ensure the profile image and "Floating Badge" are properly centered and sized on mobile devices.

2. **Elegant Animations (AOS Library):**

   * **Integration:** Add the **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** library to the project.

   * **Dynamic Effects:**

     * **Hero Section:** Fade-up effects for text and a smooth entrance for the profile image.

     * **Cards & Sections:** Staggered `fade-up` and `zoom-in` animations for Experience and Skills cards as the user scrolls down.

     * **Interactivity:** Ensure animations are smooth and responsive, enhancing the "Neo-Brutalist" feel without being overwhelming.

3. **Refinement:**

   * Verify that all "Neo-Brutalist" shadows and borders look consistent on smaller screens.

   * Ensure the Language Switcher remains accessible on mobile.
